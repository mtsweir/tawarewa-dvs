      <h1>Hi, Max</h1>
      <p class="lead">Will your investment property pass the ‘test’ next year?</p>
			<p>Since we last spoke to you in March 2017, there’s been a change in government – and subsequently, a lot more chatter around the state of New Zealand’s rental housing stock. The passing of the Healthy Homes Bill in December 2017 means there are changes coming, as soon as next year, which will require landlords to guarantee any new tenancy from July 1, 2019 must be either properly insulated or contain a heating source able to make the home warm and dry. All tenancies must meet the new standards by July 1, 2024.</p>
			<p>The issue with this is heating a home won’t make it dry. Without properly-designed and installed whole house ventilation, dampness and mould can continue to grow in a home, despite a landlord’s best efforts in heating and insulating the property.</p>
			<p>We’re hearing of more and more Kiwi families struggling through winter, their houses riddled with mould which severely affects their health. There’s been a lot of talk about tenants not being able to afford the heating their landlords are installing for them as well – a factor that could be reversed if the house was properly ventilated and insulated – as drier homes can be easier to heat.</p>
			<p class="lead">Take the onus away from your tenants - it's an investment</p>
			<p>If you’re a landlord, especially in lower socio-economic areas, do the right thing by addressing the three key factors needed to create a healthy home; insulation, heating and whole house ventilation. This will help bring electricity costs down so tenants will actually use their heating, while also keeping your investment free from damage caused by dampness and mould. And, most importantly, it will help keep your tenants healthy through winter.</p>
			<p>Tenants are also likely to stay longer in a rental property that’s warm and doesn’t compromise their health, reducing the costs of high tenant turnover – not to mention the fact they’ll respect the home more. Those in a damp/cold home are more likely to suffer avoidable illness, often resulting in unplanned medical bills and time off work. Unexpected financial burdens like this increase the risk of missed rent payments.</p>
			<p>Although it’s likely you may need to increase the rent to cover these investments, ask yourself whether your tenants would rather live in a mouldy, unhealthy dwelling which is slightly cheaper or a healthy, warm and dry one that will improve their lives and decrease their bills elsewhere such as cutting down on doctors’ visits. Improving your dwelling makes it a more desirable prospect, tenants pay more, a purchaser will pay more if you decide to sell, and you'll see less ongoing maintenance costs from dampness, mould and other issues.</p>
			<p class="lead">The Solution</p>
			<p>The DVS EC Automatic Ventilation System uses positive pressure technology to push out the stale, unhealthy, moisture-laden air in a home.</p>
			<p>Simplicity is the key - your tenants don't need to do a thing because the DVS system takes care of itself. Power consumption is only $1.50 per month for an average home so there’s no need to worry about high energy bills, and you can relax knowing your investment property will stay dry and fresh all year round.</p>
